 Through the Innovation for Uptake, Scale and Equity in Immunization (INFUSE), GAVI is accepting applications for proven digital technology innovations that provide more effective methods of identity registration to accelerate improved immunization coverage and delivery. The innovations should greatly enhance the efficacy of immunization delivery, and modernize methods to identify and register the children who most need life-saving vaccines and who currently are being missed by legacy processes. INFUSE, aims to identify proven solutions that, when expanded, have the greatest potential to modernize global health and immunization delivery. INFUSE was launched by GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2016 in Davos. One in five children in GAVI-supported countries do not receive a full course of the most basic vaccines. One reason for this gap is that an increasing number of people do not live under the radar. <img data-attachment-id="3947" data-permalink="https://outrepreneurs.com/2018/02/are-you-a-healthcare-innovator-apply-for-equity-funding-at-infuse-2018/infuse/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infuse.png?fit=709%2C421&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="709,421" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="infuse" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infuse.png?fit=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infuse.png?fit=604%2C359&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone wp-image-3947 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infuse.png?resize=604%2C359&#038;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infuse.png?w=709&amp;ssl=1 709w, https://i1.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/infuse.png?resize=300%2C178&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Nearly 1.1 billion people worldwide, including one in three children under five, lack any proof of identification. Without a reliable record that can be uniquely linked to each child, it is difficult to determine the care he or she needs. The latest digital technologies can provide more effective ways of registering births, issuing proof of identity and authenticating identities to allow access to essential health services. This is especially important for girls, who are more likely to suffer the repercussions of not being registered. These technologies can help the developing countries that GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance supports to accelerate immunization delivery, ensure equity, drive efficiencies in health systems, and facilitate access to a broader range of social services and opportunities throughout children’s lifetimes. Each year, INFUSE calls for innovations that can help GAVI, governments and partners reach more children with life-saving vaccines. INFUSE then works with expert partners to select the most promising innovations and “infuse” them with the capital, expertise and other support needed to scale them up. The deadline for this year’s applications is 10 April 2018. Apply now HERE.  comments
