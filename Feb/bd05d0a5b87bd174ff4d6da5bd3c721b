The Federal Government of Nigeria has launched a project called StartUp Mambila as part of initiative to drive the growth of innovative clusters and technological enterprise across the country. The StartUp Mambila project, organized by NENHUB, with the support of the National Social Investment Programme (NSIP), an arm of the Federal Government of Nigeria, will focus on tackling the socio-economic challenges ravaging the North-eastern part of Nigeria. Entries have started for early stage tech startups in the North-eastern part of the country to participate in a 6-month incubation programme. Each of the participants will receive $5,000 equity free funding at the completion of the incubation. “The “StartUp Mambila” Project seeks to increase regional activity of innovative clusters and encourage innovation across various sectors of the economy. The goal is for 25,000 Nigerians to be trained and developed as young creative talents, equipped and supported to meet the local and international demand for digital enterprise,” the organisers said. To qualify, applicants must be Nigerian between the ages of 18 – 35 with idea or solution applicable to solving a specific business problem in the North-east region of Nigeria.
