LifeBank, a Nigerian startup delivering blood to hospitals, has raised $200,000 in a new seed round that involved EchoVC Partners, a Lagos-based venture capital firm, Fola Laoye, an angel investor, and Co-Creation Hub, a Nigerian social innovation centre. The funding is meant to expand the operations of LifeBank to Abuja, Nigeria’s capital and Kaduna, a state in the northern part of Nigeria, in the next 18 months. Temie Giwa-Tubosun , Lifebank’s founder and CEO,  said it is crucial for the company to expand to northern Nigeria where private health services are not rampant and participate more in a public-sector led market, according to Quartz, an online media platform. “It’s increasingly clear that to get a significant chunk of the market we have to work with government systems. We want to use Kaduna as a model of what we can do in that market.” said Giwa-Tubosun. LifeBank charges fee from delivering pints of blood to local hospitals in Lagos. The startup has earned revenues of nearly $100,000 since its launch in 2015. Last year, LifeBank was part of the Co-Creation Hub (CcHub) and Google PitchDrive when 14 African tech startups  were taken on a three-week European tech hub tour with the aim of  raising of EUR20 million (US$22 million) in investments. For the expansion drive, the company will also diversify into other medical products such as oxygen, vaccines and antivenin, which are usually in short supply in Nigeria’s local hospitals.
