Sjoerd Nikkelen, Chief Executive Officer, OLX Asia, Middle East and Africa, has confirmed the news making the rounds that OLX would be shutting down its physical operations in Nigeria. Nikklen, according to a report on Techpoint.ng, was quoted as saying that the online marketplace site made the decision to consolidate its operations in some of its international offices. “We made a difficult but important decision in Nigeria to consolidate our operations between some of our offices internationally,” Nikkelen said. “Our marketplace will continue to operate here — uninterrupted — as it has since 2010, and we remain committed to the many people here who use our platform to buy and sell every month. We continue to be focused on constantly innovating to make sure that OLX remains the top classifieds platform in the country.” Nikkeleen added that the company is committed “to helping our affected colleagues during this transition and have already offered them meaningful financial and other support.” About 100 staff of OLX in Nigeria will be affected by the decision, according to Punch newspapers. The affected staff will leave the company in March and the management in April. In 2010, Naspers, a global internet company, acquired OLX by buying out the shares of the previous Venture capitalists in the company.
