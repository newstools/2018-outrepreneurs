This February, leading accelerator for women, She Leads Africa, is bringing the Slay Festival to Lagos, Nigeria.  Holding on the 17th day of February at the Tafawa Balewa Square on Lagos Island, the festival brings together aspiring and emerging female entrepreneurs to share ideas and learn from selected seasoned female entrepreneurs. Among them are South Africa’s television presenter, author and entrepreneur, Bonang Matheba, who is the keynote speaker. If there is one woman who can tell us about building a global African brand, it is definitely Miss Matheba. From her groundbreaking deal with Revlon as the first non-American and only Global Brand Ambassador, to her innovative combination of technology and media with her very own app, the ladies are sure to be motivated by Bonang. Nigeria’s Yemi Odusanya, popularly known as Sisi Yemmie, is a content creator, food and lifestyle blogger and vlogger. With over 100,000 subscribers on YouTube, she is one of the pioneers of YouTube vlogging in Nigeria. She is also a contributor for various online magazines, including Guardian Life. Ladies looking to learn how to turn online content into cash, shouldn’t Miss Sisi’s speaker session.  <img data-attachment-id="3914" data-permalink="https://outrepreneurs.com/2018/02/africas-biggest-event-for-ladies-in-entrepreneurship-to-happen-in-lagos/slay-fest-picture/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/slay-fest-picture.jpg?fit=1280%2C853&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1280,853" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="slay fest picture" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/slay-fest-picture.jpg?fit=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/slay-fest-picture.jpg?fit=604%2C402&amp;ssl=1" class="wp-image-3914 size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/slay-fest-picture.jpg?resize=604%2C402&#038;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/slay-fest-picture.jpg?resize=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/slay-fest-picture.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/slay-fest-picture.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/slay-fest-picture.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/slay-fest-picture.jpg?w=1208&amp;ssl=1 1208w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Dolapo Oni-Sijuwade, considered to be one of Nigeria’s top female TV presenters has starred in “The Governor’s Wife,” “Vexed,” “Diary of a Lagos Girl” and “Desperate Housewives Africa.” Now a host of E!
