With the aim of ushering in a new era of growth and economic development driven by high-impact entrepreneurship in the country, global accelerator, Endeavor, has berthed in Nigeria. Launching with support from local business leaders and a partnership with Omidyar Network, Endeavor Nigeria will support entrepreneurs and companies that have passed through the initial start-up phase and who demonstrate the potential for rapid expansion and scale. Endeavor Nigeria will be led by a strong founding board, chaired by Atedo Peterside, Founder of IBTC Bank (now StanbicIBTC Bank), and Vice-Chaired by Bolaji Balogun, CEO of Chapel Hill Denham and CIO of Nigeria Infrastructure Debt Fund. The founding board, which convened for the first time in January, will also include Suresh Chellaram, Managing Director of Chellarams PLC; Mitchell Elegbe, Founder and CEO of Interswitch; Faysal El Khalil, Chairman of Seven Up Bottling Company; Jaideep Gulab, CEO of Assan Oil Mills and Chairman of Rosemonde Limited; and Yemi Lalude, Managing Partner at TPG Growth. The local entrepreneurship ecosystem in Lagos is currently valued at $2 billion, and is believed to be the most valuable in Africa, despite having fewer companies than Cape Town, Africa’s largest ecosystem as measured by the number of companies.  In 2016, Nigeria attracted more investment than any other startup ecosystem in Africa, due in large part to the concentration of companies in rapidly growing sectors such as fintech. The size of the potential market in Nigeria is also notable for the success of companies in traditional sectors such as consumer, personal care, insurance and other financial services. This pool of high-growth tech and non-tech companies in Lagos with potential to significantly scale internationally needs access to the sort of services Endeavor works to provide, promoting the right mix of talent, funding and networks to accelerate high-impact entrepreneurship that can transform the local economy and the wider region through large-scale job creation, investment, and innovation. “We’re thrilled to launch Endeavor in Nigeria with strong support from Omidyar Network, continuing our expansion in Sub-Saharan Africa,” said Endeavor Co-founder and CEO Linda Rottenberg. “With the entrepreneurship ecosystem in Lagos growing rapidly, Endeavor Nigeria is well-positioned to make a big impact by providing vital support for the most promising entrepreneurs and emerging companies as they grow and look to scale.” <img data-attachment-id="3928" data-permalink="https://outrepreneurs.com/2018/02/endeavor-launches-in-nigeria-continuing-expansion-of-high-impact-entrepreneurship-movement-in-sub-saharan-africa/endeavour-nigeria/" data-orig-file="https://i1.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/endeavour-nigeria.jpg?fit=768%2C440&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="768,440" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1518191406&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="endeavour nigeria" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/endeavour-nigeria.jpg?fit=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/endeavour-nigeria.jpg?fit=604%2C346&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone wp-image-3928 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/endeavour-nigeria.jpg?resize=604%2C346&#038;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/endeavour-nigeria.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/endeavour-nigeria.jpg?resize=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Endeavor Nigeria Managing Director, Eloho Omame (fifth from left), with the Endeavor Nigeria Founding Board at their inaugural meeting in January Endeavor Nigeria’s day to day operations will be led by Eloho Omame, a former investment banker and private equity investor. Before leaving to join Endeavor as pioneer Managing Director for Nigeria, she founded Amari, a proprietary firm focused on working with, and selectively investing in early stage, innovation-driven companies in Nigeria. At Amari, she led consulting projects for public and private sector clients in the areas of corporate innovation, startup support and entrepreneurial ecosystem development, notably working with the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund to design, implement and launch a set of programs aimed at very early stage founders, branded ‘Lagos Innovates’. “Endeavor’s trademark support will be of tremendous help to Nigerian entrepreneurs at a crucial point in their journeys; when they are poised to scale their businesses,” said Omidyar Network Managing Partner Matt Bannick.  “We at Omidyar Network congratulate the Endeavor team on their continued expansion into Sub-Saharan Africa, and look forward to seeing Endeavor Nigeria’s contribution to a growing ecosystem of entrepreneurship.” Endeavor is a 20 year-old nonprofit organization that is leading the global movement to facilitate long-term economic growth by selecting, mentoring, and accelerating the best high-impact entrepreneurs around the world.
