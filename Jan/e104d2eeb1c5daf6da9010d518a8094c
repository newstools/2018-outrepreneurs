Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF)is inviting entrepreneurs with business ideas that can transform Africa to apply for its 2018 Tony Elumelu Entrepreneurship Programme ( TEEP). TEEP began four years ago with $100 million commitment from TEF to identify, train, mentor and fund 10,000 African entrepreneurs by 2024. Each year, 1000 entrepreneurs across Africa are supported with $5,000 in seed capital to run their ideas. Selected applicants are also given additional funding when they are able to scale their business. Apart from the funding, the programme includes a 12- week intensive online training on managing a successful business, mentoring to guide them through the early transformation stages of the business and access to the largest network of African start-ups and TEF’s own global contacts. “When we launched the TEF Programme and committed $100 million to empowering Africa’s entrepreneurs,” said Tony Elumelu, founder, TEF, “I knew we would create impact, but I never imagined it would be impact of this magnitude. “We have unleashed a movement of African entrepreneurs — a force so strong, so inspiring, that I am confident they will collectively transform Africa. We need Africa’s best and brightest entrepreneurs to come learn, grow their businesses and build our continent.” Applicants must be at least 18 and a legal resident or citizen of an African country, with a ‘for-profit’ business based in Africa. Tony Elumelu Foundation was established in 2010 to promote entrepreneurship in Africa and be a catalyst for the social and economic development of the continent. Interested individuals can apply for the programme here. The deadline is on 1 March 2018. comments
