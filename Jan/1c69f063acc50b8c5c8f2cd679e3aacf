AgroCenta runs one of the largest agriculture businesses in Ghana without owning a single farmland. Mike is a software engineer who created a platform to aggregate and connect small holder farmers to big companies that need their produce. He is currently working with a brewery…. building the future of farming in Africa. The start-up aims to sign up 1000 farmers, working on 1000 hectares of land in Ghana, barely scratching the surface of opportunities!
