All On has partnered with Co-Creation Hub to launch the Clean Energy Innovation Challenge aimed at fostering increased access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy sources in Nigeria. The Clean Energy Innovation Challenge will find and support energy innovators across Nigeria to get their ideas on the path of growth and profitability. According to the organizers, 10 finalists that emerge from the challenge will receive incubation support and the top four ventures will receive pre-seed investment of $10,000 each from All On. “We are seeking innovative ideas for delivering affordable, reliable and sustainable energy through new sources for low income households, SMEs and communities (read the information on the website of All On). “All On works with partners to increase access to commercial energy products and services for under-served and un-served off-grid energy markets in Nigeria, with a special focus on the Niger Delta.” The early stage energy innovator applying for the challenge must be a Nigerian, living and operating a business in the country.
