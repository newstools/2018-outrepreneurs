African tech startups developing solutions that can improve the lives of children can get up to $90 thousand equity-free investment from  UNICEF’s Innovation Fund. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), in its continued drive to impact the lives of the most vulnerable children, wants to support early stage startups with open source projects in frontier technology such as blockchain, UAVs, virtual and augmented reality, and 3D printing. Other areas include machine learning, quantum computing, genetic engineering, internet of things, artificial intelligence, nano-satellites and human dynamics. “We are interested in companies that use distributed ledger tech in new groundbreaking ways that are scalable and globally applicable,” UNICEF said. According UNICEF, there is also technical assistance to be provided for selected startups apart from the funding. Selected startups will work with expert mentors and be connected to UNICEF’s network in order to assist in scaling and maximising impact. Any startup interested in the innovation fund must have been registered in any of UNICEF’s programme countries and have a working, open source prototype (hardware or software) showing promising results.   comments
