The Obama Foundation seeks to identify emerging African leaders from all sectors who have demonstrated a commitment to advancing common good, to participate in the inaugural class of the Leaders Africa Program. Â This program is aimed at talented individuals who are on the right trajectory at earlier stages of their journey, as well as those who have already attained success. The objective of the program is to build a growing network of innovative and ethical change makers in sectors including government, civil society, and the private sector, who seek to drive positive change in their communities. Successful candidates will have a demonstrated potential for impact, a clear commitment to integrity, and a commitment to stay engaged with the Obama Foundation throughout the year and beyond. The inaugural class of the Leaders Africa Program will convene in Johannesburg, South Africa from July 14 through July 18, 2018, as well as participate in robust online activities throughout the year. Costs related to economy class travel, lodging, and meals throughout the July 14-18 duration of the program will be footed by the foundation. <img data-attachment-id="4061" data-permalink="https://outrepreneurs.com/2018/03/the-obama-foundation-calls-on-young-africans-to-participate-in-the-leaders-africa-program/obama-foundation-1/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/obama-foundation-1.png?fit=1497%2C717&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1497,717" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="obama foundation 1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i1.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/obama-foundation-1.png?fit=300%2C144&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i1.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/obama-foundation-1.png?fit=604%2C289&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone wp-image-4061 " src="https://i0.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/obama-foundation-1.png?resize=604%2C289&#038;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/obama-foundation-1.png?resize=1024%2C490&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/obama-foundation-1.png?resize=300%2C144&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/obama-foundation-1.png?resize=768%2C368&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/obama-foundation-1.png?resize=1320%2C632&amp;ssl=1 1320w, https://i0.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/obama-foundation-1.png?w=1497&amp;ssl=1 1497w, https://i2.wp.com/outrepreneurs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/obama-foundation-1.png?w=1208&amp;ssl=1 1208w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" data-recalc-dims="1" /> Applications should be submitted via this link, no later than 6:00 PM ET (11:00 PM GMT) on March 25, 2018.
