She was recognized by Time Magazine as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the world and by The New York Times as one of the 25 Women of Impact for 2015. She was Vice President of the World Bank (Africa Region) with responsibilities for operations in 48 countries, with a lending portfolio of about $40 billion. She also worked as the Nigerian Minister of Education and later as Minister of Solid Minerals. Oby exudes passion and strength. We recorded this episode as a live event at the Ventures Platform in Abuja with few people in the audience. Recording this podcast was an insight into her phenomenal mind. Towards the end of the interview, I asked her what she would have been doing if she was 20 younger. “I would probably build 20 startups” She said.
